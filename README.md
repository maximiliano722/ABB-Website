## Introduction ##

This project is a design made for Aggie Bussiness Brothers offical website. The following website contains a landing page, about page, page with a list of the current members as well as executive members, sponsers, recruitment page and some pages that are only to be accessed by a member of the group itself. This app was designed with the intention of giving them a website that they can use through the lifetime of the group with of course little updates here and there.

## Installation ##

Download this code repository by using git:

 `git clone https://github.com/maximiliano722/ABB-Website.git`


## Tests ##

An RSpec test suite is available and can be ran using:

  `rspec spec/`

## Execute Code ##

Run the following code in Powershell if using windows or the terminal using Linux/Mac

  `cd your_github_here`

  `docker run --rm -it --volume "$(pwd):/rails_app" -e DATABASE_USER=test_app -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=test_password -p 3000:3000 dmartinez05/ruby_rails_postgresql:latest`

  `cd rails_app`

Install the app

  `bundle install && rails webpacker:install && rails db:create && db:migrate`

Run the app
  `rails server --binding:0.0.0.0`

The application can be seen using a browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000/

## Environmental Variables/Files ##

Google OAuth2 support requires two keys to function as intended: Client ID and Client Secret

Create a new file called application.yml in the /config folder and add the following lines:

  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_HERE'`

  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE'`
  
In order to successfully deploy a new app, you'll need to export this key into the heroku environment variables:
   
   RAILS_MASTER_KEY
   
This will help your application gain access to two more credentails (AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY) that are encrypted in the config/credentials.yml file, and these values are needed for the application to use AWS S3's storage services. 
  
  ## Cloud Image Storage ##
The images uploaded within this application are stored on a cloud storage provided by AWS's S3 service.
The images are automatically deleted from the cloud when the users and sponsors with pictures are deleted on the application.
A variable called RAILS_MASTER_KEY should be initiailized on the app's heroku configuration variables to use S3 cloud storage; without this key, the web application will not work.

To set the extra_images on the webpage, you'll need to create extra_images with these "group" names for each page:
 Home Page: First Image, Carousel
 About page: About Image, Integrity Image, Brotherhood Image, Professionalism Image, Service Image

## Deployment ##

Setup a Heroku account: https://signup.heroku.com/

From the heroku dashboard select `New` -> `Create New Pipline`

Name the pipeline, and link the respective git repo to the pipline

Our application does not need any extra options, so select `Enable Review Apps` right away

Click `New app` under review apps, and link your test branch from your repo

Under staging app, select `Create new app` and link your main branch from your repo



## CI/CD ##

CI: Visible in .github/workflows/workflow.yml

CD: Contiously deploying two heroku apps: a test app tracking our testv2 branch and a prdocution app tracking our main branch
